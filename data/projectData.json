Updated with an emphasis on nuanced, natural detailing, this organic inspired oasis now features an exotic, Wild Agate island with glass tile splash and walls. Further accompanied by the addition of a custom sheet metal range hood, this kitchen was carefully crafted to ignite an inspired coastal comfort with an infusion of industrial elegance. Continued throughout the rest of the home, a beautiful beach-swept essence maintains, amplified abstractly by entertainment elements.<br /><br />Treated as a form of interactive art, a glass tile surround fireplace, custom pool table, and accessories were also added. Envisioned to enhance the 20’ ceilings, unique lighting fixtures ranging from modern to vintage connect and compliment through the cohesion of movement. Finally, finished through intellectual artistry like a sculpture niche with specialty lighting, this high-brow hideaway gives way to gorgeous views that are embodied in this escape-worthy elevation.",

Experimenting with as many materials as I could, immersing myself in the artistic and design processes, I have honed these skills for decades in my professional life as an Interior Designer. When looking for creative and immersive, dynamic and thoughtful ways to cover large multi story surfaces, I developed the format for my multi-panel glass paintings. This format allows me to express color in a pure yet evocative way, translucent, and dimensional. The pieces shown are meant to enhance your living and working spaces with soothing liquid color. Each individual painting consists of two panels of tempered glass, acrylic and metal paint, framed in metal unless otherwise noted.<br /><br />Commissions welcome.<br /><br />Let your mind wander and enjoy the ride.",

Extensive changes were made to lighting to highlight the artwork of the Owner, his family, & collected artists. The exterior Bluestone hardscaping & landscaping were revamped.
